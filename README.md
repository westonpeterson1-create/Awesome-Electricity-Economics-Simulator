This is the electricity economics simulator. The README is intended for other developers, users should be instructed via the tutorial, or manual.

Sorry about the code, I know a lot of is pretty bad and includes a lot of copy-pasted sections that should have been functions.
If it contains any offensive language I will remove it, I was not always intending for this to be public. I also expect you to not add any.

I am open minded so feel free to try improving or adding whatever if you have any ideas, just stay in line with the projects goal of being 
educational and mostly accurate.
