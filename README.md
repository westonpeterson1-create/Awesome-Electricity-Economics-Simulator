This is the electricity economics simulator. The README is intended for other developers, users should be instructed via the tutorial, or manual.

Sorry about the code, I know a lot of is pretty bad and includes a lot of copy-pasted sections that should have been functions.
I think some of it also contains offensive language since I wasn't always planning on making this public.

Feel free to try and add whatever, just stay in line with the projects goal of being educational and mostly accurate.
