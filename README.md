This is the electricity economics simulator. The README is intended for other developers, users should be instructed via the tutorial, or manual. Both of these documents are to be in .docx
format, put on the git repo for any developers to edit.

I am open minded so feel free to try improving or adding whatever if you want to help, just stay in line with the projects goal of being 
educational and mostly accurate. Even things like helping with the tutorial, contributing the .csv files for your home state/country, or replacing copy pasted values with a named variable are
a huge help. If by some miracle you actually do want to contribute, I can give you the rundown on where everything is if you need it.

This was my first big programming project, a lot of extremely fundamental parts of the code are an unmitigated clusterf *ahem*, disaster. Read it if you dare.

If the code contains any offensive language I will remove it, I was not always intending for this to be public. If you contribute anything try not to add any more of this.
